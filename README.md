# isr-dev-test-dtc

==> For this test I choose WordPress because I'm comfortable with it especially on designing. Since its more flexibity and diverse when it comes to design. Also, I consider the days given for the 2 test site. 

Thus, I proceed with the frameworks I'm comfortable and more experience considering the time limit.


NOTE: Page builder (Elementor) is the only plugin installed.
